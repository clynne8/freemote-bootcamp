<h1> Hello my name is Courtney </h1>
<h3> Why did I join Freemote? </h3>
  <div id="cotainer">
    <p> <span class="first-letter">I</span> have already taken a course for ecommerce but it did not teach how to write code, it only showed how to edit certain areas of the code to customize your store on shopify. I wanted to learn more about coding and how to build and customize a site instead of tailoring a general theme that everyone uses on shopify.</P>
  <p> <span class="first-letter">I</span> am looking forward to picking up work to make some extra money so I can finish paying off my students loans & start saving up to buy a house, whenever the housing market starts to level out.
<p> <span class="first-letter">M</span>y overall goal is to grow my own business so I can work from anywhere that has internet and provide for my family (especially if my  spouse goes to law school).
</div>
<h4>I'm ready to learn!</h4>
